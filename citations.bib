In particular, we develop and prove an algorithm for a fast, direct method for skipping ahead in the random sequence by an arbitrarily large positive or negative {open_quotes}stride.{close_quotes} This algorithm is currently used in three different production-level Monte Carlo codes on a variety of parallel, vector, and distributed computer systems to generate the initial seeds for different particle histories. In the extreme cases, the algorithm can reduce several years of {open_quotes}brute-force{close_quotes} computation to a few hundred microseconds.},
